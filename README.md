# Filtering-Meta-Data

Filters meta data for a list of NSW samples read from a file called "Target_samples"
Download metadata from the rnr database for the genus of interest and label this as Database_File.csv

The script reads the "Replace_List.csv" to abbreviate any names and remove double spacing etc..

outputs will be in a "Filtered_Outputs" file

note: as this script combines multiple columns together, sometimes site names are duplicated in the final output. you will need to manually screen the final oputput

See "Planchonella australis filtered metadata file.xlsx" as an example output of the script.

# Filtering-Meta-Data

Filters meta data for a list of NSW sample from a file called "Target_samples.csv"
Download metadata from the rnr database for the genus of interest and name this file as "Database_File.csv"

The script reads the "Replace_List.csv" which abbreviates any names and removes double spacing etc. e.g. "National Park" to "NP"

outputs will be in a "Filtered_Outputs" file

note: as this script combines multiple columns together, sometimes site names are duplicated in the final output. you will need to manually screen the final oputput

See "Planchonella australis filtered metadata file.xlsx" as an example output of the script.
